This is obviously dependent on other research.  Specifically we would want to know which demographics use our services most (probably english speaking people 30 - 55?)  Then we can devote more resources to the affiliate channels and similar channels which other research (or this data, i guess, depending on its size) suggests are most popular with these demographics
