-- Question 61 - Ranking vendors by spend

-- Suppose you have a table called 'vendor_spend' containing vendor spend data, as shown below:

-- vendor_spend:
-- 	vendor_id 	name 	contract_sign_date 	total_spend
-- 0 	1 	vendor_schmendor 	2018-09-01 	34324
-- 1 	2 	parts_r_us 	2018-09-03 	23455
-- 2 	3 	vendor_king 	2018-10-11 	77654
-- 3 	4 	vendor_diagram 	2018-08-21 	23334
-- 4 	5 	venny 	2018-08-13 	94843
-- 5 	6 	vendtriloquist 	2018-10-29 	23444

-- Using SQL, write a query to show the top 50% of vendors as denoted by total spend. You should return both the name and spend for this group.

SELECT @num_vendors := count(vendor_id) FROM vendor_spend;
SELECT *
FROM vendor_spend
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT round(@num_vendors/2, 0);
