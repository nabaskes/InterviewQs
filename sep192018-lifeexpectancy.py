# Question 31 - Life expectancy

# Suppose you're analyzing a population of 100,000 people, and you're trying to understand life expectancy. Within this population of 100,000 people, 75% can expect to live to the age of 70, while 45% can expect to live to age 80. Given that a person is 70, what is the probability that they live to the age 80?

75000 live to 70
45000 live to 80

Considering that everyone who lives to 80 has lived to 70, then
45000/75000 = 60% of people who live to 70 live to 80.

So you have a 60% chance...

Sorry mate.
