# 20 	blue 	88 	Willard Morris
# 19 	blue 	95 	Al Jennings
# 22 	yellow 	92 	Omar Mullins
# 21 	green 	70 	Spencer McDaniel

# The dataframe is showing information about a group of students. Write code using Python Pandas to select the rows where the students' favorite color is blue or yellow and their grade is above 90.
