# Question 26 - Is red independent from an ace? (another card problem)

# Is drawing a red card and drawing an ace independent? You can read more about a standard card deck here. Hint: Drawing an ace (event A) and drawing a red card (event B) are two separate events -- think of a way to prove (using probability theory) that knowing whether event A occurred impacts the probability of event B occuring.

Two results are statistically independent if the likelihood of one occuring is not affected by the likelihood of another occuring.

In this case, there are two colors, each containing 26 cards, two of which are aces.  So, given that the card is red, we have a 1/13 chance of it being an ace.

Given that the card is an ace, it's either red or black, so there's a 1/2 chance of it being red.  So they are independent.

That said, this is an interesting scenario because if the deck isn't complete (for instance, we removed a few cards), the features would not necessarily be independent, because there could be fewer cards of one color or of one type.
