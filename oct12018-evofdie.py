# Question 36 - Rolling to win!

# Suppose you are playing a game with a fair die (e.g. no bias for any one side), and your expected payout based on the # you roll is shown the table below. If you have to pay $1 to play, is it worth the cost to play?
# Roll 	Payout
# 6 	$4
# 5 	$2
# 4 	$1
# 3 	$0
# 2 	$0
# 1 	$0

Generally, we just need to calculate the expected value.  This takes the form of an integral of the result function over the probability space.

For a discrete space, this is

(1/6) Î£_i V_i

Since each step has the same likelihood, its just

sum(Payout) / len(Roll) = 7/6

This is greater than 1 so you're likely to prevail.

That said, this has a fifty percent chance of you losing all your money.  So, if you do it a large number of times you'll very likely profit, but for a small number of times you very likely would not
