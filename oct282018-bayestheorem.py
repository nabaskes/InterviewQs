Bayes Theorem is a theorem from statistics that, vaguely, says that the likelihood of something happening should be judged relative to the prior understanding of the likelihood.

So if something sounds really outlandish, we need more convincing statistical evidence to say that it's true.  Similarly, we're inclined to believe obvious things based on very little or very unconvincing data.

This is obviously useful for like the normal data science process when we're trying to predict something using stats.  It's also useful as inspiration for the Naive Bayes Classifier, which is a type of classification algorithms.
